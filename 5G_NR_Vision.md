## Why do we need something better than 4G? 
- User generated content growing in volume and quality
- number of devices per person increasing
- ultra high speeds and network capacity
- low lag for real time , interactive apps
- diverse service under one umbrella
- connecting everything and everyone

## 5G services classes
### eMBB {enhanced mobile bandwidth } : further high speed internet
- *use case* : used in real time streaming/gaming , cloud computing , thing which require high data network
- emphasis on higher speeds and spectral effeciency
     - bandwidth and power usage is secondory
- peak uer data rate > 10 Gbps
- network throughput > 1 Tbps
- operation in macro and small cells
    - macro cells : cell towers / bae stations , more broad , covers few sqkm
    - small cells :miniature vers of macro , eg malls etc
 - support for high-speed mobility upto 500 kmph

### mMTC/mIOT (massive machine type comm/massive internet of things} : connecting everthing around us .  
- *use case* :alld devices which otherwise wouldnt connect to a network will now be provided with reliable network connectivity regardless of where they are ex: home devices , sensors , industrial robotic devices , fitness tracker etc
- emphasis on power conservation and simplicity of protocols , instead of speed and effeciency
- support for high device effeciency upto 1 mill devices/km^2
- operation over long range and in challenging coverage conditions
- simple low cost devices
- long battery life ex upto 10 years

### URLLC { ultra reliable , low-latency communication } : real time interactive apps 
- *use case* : mission critical comm , remote surgery , self driving cars , where high reliability and low latency is needed
- emphasis on E2E latency , instead of speed ( ex less than 1ms )
- ultra high reliability and availability
- support for high speed mobility
- fundamental redesign of protocols

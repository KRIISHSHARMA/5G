### advantages of high frequency :

- more antennas : the size of the antenna needed to work at a specific frequency is inversely proportional to that frequency, meaning that as your frequency of operation goes higher and higher, the size of the antenna that is needed to optimally send or receive signals and that wireless frequency begins to reduce and reduce .
  
- directivity : When you have these more antennas on the Ginobil which are typically arranged in a two dimensional rectangular panel, you have two options. You can either let each antenna work as an individual and do its own thing or you have the option to make some or all of those antennas work together in unison as one unit and coordinate the kind and amount of energy that they transmit outwards. And when you execute some smart signal processing algorithms in the back end to make multiple antenna elements work together in unison. What happens is that rather than just translating their energy in any random direction, what they can do is they can coordinate with each other and focus their energy in a certain precise direction of interest.

- spacial reuse : Let's say that you have access to two frequencies: frequency f_1 and frequency f_2. Let's say that f_2 is substantially higher than frequency f_1. If you were to build a cellular base station at frequency f_1, let's say this is the base station, then at frequency f_1, maybe this would be the coverage of a cell at frequency f_1. Let's say that at frequency f_1 you have access to channel bandwidth of W megahertz and that leads to a network capacity of C bits per second. Let's assume that for now. Now, imagine that at frequency f_2, you have access to the same channel bandwidth, W. Let's not toy around with those variables just yet. If you play your cards right, it should be possible for you to get capacity C while operating at frequency f_2 as shown. There are certain assumptions in wireless and digital communications involved here that I have prepared upon but stay with me here for a minute. Let's assume that at frequency f_1 channel bandwidth of W gives you network capacity of C. This is your cell radius at frequency f_1. Now because frequency f_2 is significantly higher than f_1, its Pathloss will be significantly higher than that for f_1 as well. As such, the signal that you might send from this base station at frequency f_2 will attenuate much quicker as compared to the signal at frequency f_1. That would mean that the coverage radius of a hypothetical cell deployed from the same location at frequency f_2 will be substantially lower than that at frequency f_1. Let's say that this is the cell coverage at frequency f_2. I hope you are with me up to this point. What it means is that if you were to deploy a cellular network on frequency f_2, you would get coverage in the smaller dotted circle but outside that dotted circle, you wouldn't get coverage at f_2. You don't have to stop there either, you can deploy another base station here at f_2 and it'll give you coverage like this and you can continue doing so N times in a given geographical area. Now, once again, one might ask a basic question, hey, if two things operate at the same time on the same frequency, you said earlier that they'll interfere with each other. Well, that premise still holds true but keep in mind that the wireless coverage of this cell, let's say cell 1, ends over here. In this region there is no coverage by cell 1, that is, the wireless signal from cell 1 ends so to speak ''At about this point beyond which you can start building a new cell.'' That is the reason why because coverage is naturally limited at frequency f_2. These cells: cell 1 and cell 2, will not interfere with each other in the coverage area of the other cell. That is how interference will be mitigated or altogether eliminated. Just by taking advantage of the fact that naturally the wireless coverage of cell 1 dies over here and coverage of cell 2 will die over here. Wherever the coverage of one cell attenuates, that is when you can begin a new cell. Given that, a given cell at f_2 is still capable of giving us a capacity of c bits per second. If you have N cells at f_2, the area two-port that you'll be able to get at frequency f_2 will be N times C bits per second, whereas the area throughput at frequency f_1 is just C bits per second because you are able to accommodate only one cell at frequency f_1 in that area. Notice something remarkable that has happened. Without utilizing additional bandwidth just by taking advantage of the natural fact that at higher frequencies coverage is limited, you are able to deploy multiple cells at higher frequency within the same geographical area , and as such, you are able to boost the network capacity offered in that geographical area by N fold equivalent to the number of cells you're able to deploy. Such magnification of network throughput or capacity that is achieved by deploying more cells in the same area or packing the cells more densely is called cell densification. That is the third principle that gives us a significant advantage in terms of millimeter-wave. That is where higher Pathloss leads to better spatial reuse, meaning you could reuse the same space for multiple cells, i.e, fit many more cells, pack them densely, that is, network densification. Spatial reuse and network densification share this relationship. It is higher Pathloss and brilliantly taking advantage of that fact is what allows us and millimeter-wave deployments to densify the network and ultimately significantly improve not just the network capacity, but data speeds that are achievable by individual users

## mmWave Deployment Opportunities Overview :

![Screenshot from 2023-10-31 17-23-07](https://github.com/KRIISHSHARMA/5G/assets/86760658/85fc29b9-693b-4e02-b22a-6f75342593bb)

## mmWave for Urban & Suburban Deployments : 
- dense urban deployment = dense no. of UE =  more building penetration loss so ,  => small coverage , smaller size = more cells , densifying the network , big band width = less interfernce
- isp wire connection => expensive
   - if isp uses 5G mmwave base station it would to easier to add subscribers 

## mmWave for Rural Deployments : homes sperated from each other

-From an Internet service provider's viewpoint, it becomes not just expensive, but somewhat prohibitive to run individual cables from a local hub to those individual homes that are separated far apart. That's why rural areas don't garner much attention from established ISPs for economical reasons, and that is one prominent reason why rural areas have traditionally been underserved, and have lagged behind as far as a broadband Internet connectivity is concerned. 

- Can millimeter wave in any way solve this challenge? Well, it definitely can. Imagine a rural area. Let's say these are your target homes. Traditionally, this would be, for example, an ISP hub. An ISP would have to run miles long cables from the hub to individual homes, which would be prohibitive, as we mentioned. Imagine on the other hand, how a millimeter wave deployment would look like. Let's say instead of a hub, the ISP, or equivalently, a cellular network operator builds a millimeter wave base station atop a tall tower, so to speak, so that it has line of sight with the entire village. Once you have a millimeter wave base station atop a tall tower, it's millimeter wave signal can reach all these homes and all the other homes in this particular town as well. On account of it's large bandwidth and other benefits, you can see that this millimeter wave base station will be in a position to provide wireless broadband connectivity to all these homes, and all the advantages regarding flexibility and scalability continue to apply.

- For example, if you have a new home over here interested in getting wireless broadband service, no worries, the wireless signal already reaches that home, and all you need to do is subscribe to that service, buy the necessary hardware and voila, within a matter of an afternoon, you have wireless broadband connectivity to your home, something that would earlier take weeks or months, if at all, it were possible. So millimeter wave is not only beneficial in urban areas, but it has some practical use cases in rural areas as well. 
- how are you going to connect it to the core network in the back-end? Wouldn't you have to run a cable after all, going to the core network, which may be located several miles away? 
- One might ask, hey, how are you going to solve that problem? Well, with the advent of millimeter wave, you don't even have to run that miles-long cable anymore. That solution technically is called the backhaul or integrated or access and backhaul solution. What happens here? Is that considered the front end? There is a millimeter wave base station, and it is providing wireless broadband service to all these homes using millimeter wave find each channel. That part is well understood. However, what about the connectivity from the base station to the core network, which in technical terms is called backhaul? What about the backhaul? Well, the backhaul in modern terms can also be millimeter wave, in that this millimeter wave base station will treat the core network just as any other user and transmit a long range millimeter wave signal back to the core network, and if you have a receiver millimeter wave base station at the core network site, it should be possible for you to receive, demodulate and decode that signal. By making this particular backhaul link work over 5G millimeter wave wireless, you have effectively obviated any need that you would

- given that mmwave signals can travel upto 5-6 miles this solution can be truly wireless for rural deployments
- *mmwave basestation dont have to rooted to ground they can be placed on trucks to provide mobility and flexibility*
- millimeter wave base station would have a wireless backhaul to the core network instead of a traditional wired backhaul.

## mmWave for Fixed Wireless Access:
- In principle, if WA devices are very similar to the internet modem and WIFI router pair that many of us have in our homes but there are crucial differences. Let's see the similarities was. In that your modem is connected via a cable to your ISP sub your internet signal gets to your home over that wire and your modem and WIFI router put together translate that signal from the wired medium into a wireless medium. However, some of the disadvantages of that paradigm is that because your ISP's cable comes to your home at pretty much one designated point, your modem and router have to be a station at that point. If it is in your living room, we all know how ugly that arrangement looks. If it is for example in your basement or in your attic, you know that you will have coverage or signal propagation challenges and you will probably get a good spirit and some of the rooms but you will probably get poorer spirits in some of the rooms. Those are some of the disadvantages of the current cable internet environment.
- But contrast to that with a potential fixed wireless access device. This FWA device is truly wireless on both ends, it has no tether wire. On one end it will receive millimeter wave signals transmitted by the nearest G Norby. And at the other end all the devices in your home, be it your laptop, your phone, fitness trackers, you're smart appliances, smart home devices, whatever they may be, they will connect to this FWA device on the other end in a wireless manner. And that is what makes FWA truly portable. In that if you want better coverage in your living room, keep an FWA in your living room. If you want better coverage inside your home office or in your kitchen or in your bedroom, you can very well keep at those locations. Furthermore, you can buy more than one FWA as you want to unlike your current internet service wherein you are limited to one modem and one router. And you can strategically place those FWAs around the house so that your house has ubiquitous high speed connectivity that is ultimately facilitated by this G Norby. So once a wireless device in your home connects to the FWA, it has end to So once a wireless device in your home connects to the FWA, it has end to end connectivity with the G Norby that is facilitated by this FWA in a fully wireless manner. And FWA essentially, it ultimately brings wireless broadband facilitated by millimeter of devices to your home.

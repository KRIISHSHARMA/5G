## wireless communication : 
### allows transfer of info between a transmitor and a receiver without physical medium , communication link uses radio frequency signals (RF) .
- components of wireless communication :
- transmitter 
- wireless signal
- wirless channel
- receiver

## radio signal prop : 
- travels at speed of light
- RSF is related to its wavelength and frequency
- a wireless transmission is an electromagnetic signal which is characterized by its wavelenght and frequency ( f - 100km to 1mm , wl - 3khz to 300Ghz)

## Carrier waves / Modulation :
- info to be exchanged is "carried" by RF signals.
  { info can be analog such as voice or digital like an email }
- RF signals used as vehicle for info are called < CARRIER WAVE >
- MODULATION - process by which we impress info onto the carrier wave for transmission { analog or digital modulation depends on nature of the data}
- at the reciever we must demodulate the carrier to restore data
- Modulation changes specific attributes of a RS such as the wavelength and frequency
- MODEM - {MO = modulation ,DEM = demodulation}

## Noise and Interference :reduce the quality of signal recieved by the user
- when info is sent over any wireless communication link , noise and possibly interference is introduced
- Noise is unwanted energy or signals
- noise is always present in any device or comm link
- some noise is generated within comm device
- when 2 nearby tranmitter use the same radio freq at the same time they create interference { n/i - interfare with attributes of RFS } 
- we quantify signal quality by the radio of desired signal to noise and or interference

## Radio spectrum : range of radio frequency over which wireless comm takes place
- mmWave : 39 GHz

## Radio channel and bandwidth : 
- radio signal that carries info uses a range of frequencies over which comm link is established
- that range of frequencies is calles a CHANNEL and its width is called BANDWIDTH

- CDMA ( code division multiple access ) - CDMA is an example of multiple access, where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel. This allows several users to share a band of frequencies

## Two ways of sharing the spectrum - FDD(frequency division duplexing) and TDD(time division duplexing)

## Cellular concept : 
- AN FM radio { single tower in city center } and a mobile network cover the city diff
- a mobile networks coverage area is divided into cells
- eachcell is served by a base station aka tower
- the cells are designed to have "tessellating"( polygons, that fit together closely without gaps or overlapping) coverage
- as you drive , you are handed off from one base station to the next by the network
